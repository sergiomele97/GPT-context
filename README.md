# Installation Guide from Terminal

Follow these steps to install GPT-Context directly from the terminal:

1. **Open Command Prompt** (cmd) on Windows.

2. **Execute the following commands**:

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/sergiomele97/GPT-context.git

   cd GPT-context

   GPT-context-installer.exe

**Note:** If you don't have python, you might need to run GPT-context-installer.exe a second time.
**Note:** If you don't have Git, you can either install it or download the ZIP from the green button on GitHub, unzip it, and run GPT-context-installer.exe as an administrator.

**AVANCED USERS** Just convert the python code on src to an .exe using pyinstaller, copy the resulting context.exe file to a known folder, and add the folder to the path.
